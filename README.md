# Coupon_acceptance_project
This project aims to predict coupon acceptance by analyzing customer behavior and demographics. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we build a model to assess the likelihood of a customer accepting a promotional coupon. The model utilizes various factors such as age, location, previous purchase behavior, and more, to make accurate predictions that can help businesses optimize their marketing strategies.
